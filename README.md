## 🔹 About Me

I am a Data Engineer with 3+ years of experience designing and optimizing cloud-based data systems for large-scale analytics and AI-driven products. Currently, I work at **HubSpot**, where I build low-latency data pipelines and secure data infrastructure supporting real-time AI agents and intelligent CRM features.

My work spans **end-to-end data engineering**—from ingesting raw, unstructured data to delivering analytics- and ML-ready datasets with strong governance, performance, and cost efficiency.

I hold a **Master’s in Applied Data Science (4.0 GPA)** and enjoy solving complex data problems at the intersection of **data engineering, cloud, and AI**.
