## 🧠 About Me

I am a **Data Engineer with 3+ years of industry experience**, currently working at **HubSpot**, where I help build the data backbone for AI-powered CRM products. My role focuses on designing **low-latency streaming systems**, **cloud-native data pipelines**, and **secure data access layers** that enable real-time, context-aware AI agents.

At HubSpot, I’ve contributed to:
- Real-time data ingestion and retrieval systems enabling **sub-200ms access** to tens of millions of CRM records  
- Scalable **streaming and batch pipelines** using Kafka, AWS, and Snowflake  
- Python-based parsers that convert **unstructured sales transcripts and emails** into ML-ready datasets  
- Snowflake compute optimization, reducing cloud costs while supporting large AI workloads  
- **Role-based access controls** ensuring GDPR-compliant handling of sensitive customer data  

Previously, I worked at **Genpact** and **Wipro**, where I built robust ELT pipelines, optimized SQL-based analytics workflows, and supported enterprise-scale data platforms.

I also hold a **Master’s degree in Applied Data Science (GPA: 4.0)** from Syracuse University.
